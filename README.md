  ## Installation
  To interact with the database, first clone the repository to your local machine. Then, run 'npm i' to install all dependencies. You will need to open a MySQL shell terminal window, log in to mysql using your own credentials, and then execute 'source db/schema.sql' to build the local database. Once that is done, you no longer need the MySQL  shell. Return to the repository and open the .env file. Store your mysql username and password in the environment variables so that the server can connect to the local database you just created. Next, in your terminal windown, enter 'npm run seeds' in order to populate the test data into the database. To start the server and invoke the application, simply run 'npm start'. Since this application is a backend only, you will need to use a product like Insomnia to test the api routes.

  ## Usage
  Use insomnia to test the api routes provided in the routes directory.
